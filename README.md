| 11  | [The Development team recently executed a database script containing several data definition language (DDL) and data manipulation language (DML) statements on an Amazon Aurora MySQL DB cluster. The release accidentally deleted thousands of rows from an important table and broke some application functionality. This was discovered 4 hours after the release. Upon investigation, a Database Specialist tracked the issue to a DELETE command in the script with an incorrect WHERE clause filtering the wrong set of rows. The Aurora DB cluster has Backtrack enabled with an 8-hour backtrack window. The Database Administrator also took a manual snapshot of the DB cluster before the release started.

### The Development team recently executed a database script containing several data definition language (DDL) and data manipulation language (DML) statements on an Amazon Aurora MySQL DB cluster. The release accidentally deleted thousands of rows from an important table and broke some application functionality. This was discovered 4 hours after the release. Upon investigation, a Database Specialist tracked the issue to a DELETE command in the script with an incorrect WHERE clause filtering the wrong set of rows. The Aurora DB cluster has Backtrack enabled with an 8-hour backtrack window. The Database Administrator also took a manual snapshot of the DB cluster before the release started. The database needs to be returned to the correct state as quickly as possible to resume full application functionality. Data loss must be minimal. How can the Database Specialist accomplish this?

- [ ] Quickly rewind the DB cluster to a point in time before the release using Backtrack.
- [x] Perform a point-in-time recovery (PITR) of the DB cluster to a time before the release and copy the deleted rows from the restored database to the original database.
- [ ] Restore the DB cluster using the manual backup snapshot created before the release and change the application configuration settings to point to the new DB cluster.
- [ ] Create a clone of the DB cluster with Backtrack enabled. Rewind the cloned cluster to a point in time before the release. Copy deleted rows from the clone to the original database.

### A company has a production Amazon Aurora Db cluster that serves both online transaction processing (OLTP) transactions and compute-intensive reports. The reports run for 10% of the total cluster uptime while the OLTP transactions run all the time. The company has benchmarked its workload and determined that a six-node Aurora DB cluster is appropriate for the peak workload. The company is now looking at cutting costs for this DB cluster, but needs to have a sufficient number of nodes in the cluster to support the workload at different times. The workload has not changed since the previous benchmarking exercise. How can a Database Specialist address these requirements with minimal user involvement?

- [ ] Split up the DB cluster into two different clusters: one for OLTP and the other for reporting. Monitor and set up replication between the two clusters to keep data consistent.
- [ ] Review all evaluate the peak combined workload. Ensure that utilization of the DB cluster node is at an acceptable level. Adjust the number of instances, if necessary.
- [ ] Use the stop cluster functionality to stop all the nodes of the DB cluster during times of minimal workload. The cluster can be restarted again depending on the workload at the time.
- [x] Set up automatic scaling on the DB cluster. This will allow the number of reader nodes to adjust automatically to the reporting workload, when needed.

### A development team at an international gaming company is experimenting with Amazon DynamoDB to store in-game events for three mobile games. The most popular game hosts a maximum of 500,000 concurrent users, and the least popular game hosts a maximum of 10,000 concurrent users. The average size of an event is 20 KB, and the average user session produces one event each second. Each event is tagged with a time in milliseconds and a globally unique identifier.

### A company uses an Amazon Redshift cluster to run its analytical workloads. Corporate policy requires that the company's data be encrypted at rest with customer managed keys. The company's disaster recovery plan requires that backups of the cluster be copied into another AWS Region on a regular basis. How should a database specialist automate the process of backing up the cluster data in compliance with these policies?

- [ ] Copy the AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer managed key from the source Region to the destination Region. Set up an AWS Glue job in the source Region to copy the latest snapshot of the Amazon Redshift cluster from the source Region to the destination Region. Use a time-based schedule in AWS Glue to run the job on a daily basis.
- [x] Create a new AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer managed key in the destination Region. Create a snapshot copy grant in the destination Region specifying the new key. In the source Region, configure cross-Region snapshots for the Amazon Redshift cluster specifying the destination Region, the snapshot copy grant, and retention periods for the snapshot.
- [ ] Copy the AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer-managed key from the source Region to the destination Region. Create Amazon S3 buckets in each Region using the keys from their respective Regions. Use Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) to schedule an AWS Lambda function in the source Region to copy the latest snapshot to the S3 bucket in that Region. Configure S3 Cross-Region Replication to copy the snapshots to the destination Region, specifying the source and destination KMS key IDs in the replication configuration.
- [ ] Use the same customer-supplied key materials to create a CMK with the same private key in the destination Region. Configure cross-Region snapshots in the source Region targeting the destination Region. Specify the corresponding CMK in the destination Region to encrypt the snapshot.
